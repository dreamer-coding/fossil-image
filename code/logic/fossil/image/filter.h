 * is specified as a 3x3 matrix of floating-point values. The scale parameter is
 * used to normalize the result, and the bias parameter is added to each pixel
 * after convolution. This operation can be used for various effects such as
 * blurring, sharpening, or edge detection depending on the kernel provided.
 *
 * @param image Pointer to the fossil_image_t structure representing the image to process.
 * @param kernel 3x3 matrix of floats representing the convolution kernel.
 * @param scale Normalization factor applied to the convolution result.
 * @param bias Value added to each pixel after convolution.
